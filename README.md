This project uses the Jikan API to show various animes. You can click on the image to view the trailer, but if there is no shadow when you hover over the image then there is no trailer. You can also view the various information
about the anime under the key visuals. This application is responsive. The animeAPI.html is the main page where you can use the API. The doc.html shows the credits from the sources, as well as my planning process for this project.
