    <h3>Goal:</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>This site is for people looking to watch an anime to get quick
        results instead of having to go through <br> multiple pages to
        find info. about a certain anime. Everything can be accessed on one page
        like the <br> rating, title, image, and users can even click on the image
        to go right to the trailer.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Notes:</h3> 
    <hr>
    <p>I think the most challenging part was accounting for nullable 
        data as well as getting my <br> dropdown to actually work
        with the data. I had to reach out to the developers about <br> some further
        information to implement the API, but other than that I think
        it was ok. Also, <br> when you hover over an image it can take you
        to the trailer to the anime. I met the requirements <br>
        by having a searchbar, dropdown, and a generate random anime
        button which counts for the <br> 3 controls, adjusting to
        multiple screen sizes and using a mixture of css flexbox and <br> grid
        to implement the layout as well as storing the users last search, whatever they <br> selected
        in the dropdown, and their current status of the random button. Also, I accounted for <br> nullable data such
        as an image or a trailer that was not available as well as if the 
        user enters <br> nothing or something that does not exist then I show
        that no data was found. As for the grade I <br> think I would give myself
        and A maybe....?
